# Hands-on Lab: Friends List Application Using Express Server with JWT

### Lab for Coursera Full Stack Developer Certificate course

In this lab, the friends object will be a JSON/dictionary with email as the key and friends object as the value. The friends object is a dictionary with firstName,lastName, DOB mapped to their respective values. You will thus be using “body” from the HTTP request instead of “query” and “params”.

Only authenticated users will be able to perform all the CRUD operations.

We will be testing the output of the endpoints on Postman.
